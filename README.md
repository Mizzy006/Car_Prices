## Project Overview
This project analyzes used car prices in the U.S. using Python, with a special focus on the popular Ford F-150 trucks.
It covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and insights on how factors like mileage, model year, and condition impact pricing.

## Tools and Libraries
Python

Pandas

Numpy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

## Key Insights
-Mileage vs Price: Strong negative correlation — prices drop as mileage increases.

-Model Year vs Price: Newer models (2017 and above) retain higher value.

-Condition Matters: Cars in "Excellent" or "Very Good" condition sell for significantly higher prices.

-Ford F-150 Focus: Trucks aged 5–7 years (2017–2019) offer the best balance between price and quality.

## Visualizations
-Price distribution histogram

-Mileage vs price scatter plot

-Condition vs price bar chart

-Correlation heatmaps

## Dataset
Source: Provided as car_prices.csv

Note: Minor cleaning was required to handle bad lines in the raw CSV.

## Future Improvements
Build a simple price prediction model using machine learning

Deep dive into more car brands (e.g., Toyota, Honda)

Deploy an interactive dashboard with Streamlit or Tableau
